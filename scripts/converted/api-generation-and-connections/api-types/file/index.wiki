This chapter shows you how to quickly create and use DreamFactory's REST APIs for SFTP, AWS S3, and more file services using the DreamFactory platform.

DreamFactory provides easy-to-use connectors for various file systems, allowing you to create RESTful APIs for file management operations without writing any code. These APIs can perform standard tasks such as:

* Creating, listing, updating, and deleting folders
* Creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting files
* Converting file formats (such as Excel to JSON)

In this section, you'll learn how to create APIs for:

* [[creating-an-sftp-rest-api|SFTP File Servers]]
* [[creating-an-aws-s3-rest-api|AWS S3]]
* [[Converting_Excel_To_Json|Converting Excel Files to JSON]]

Each tutorial walks you through the configuration process and provides examples of common operations you can perform with these APIs.

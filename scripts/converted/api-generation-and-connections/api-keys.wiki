Let's walk through each field:

* '''Application Name''' and '''Description''': The application name and description are used purely for human consumption, so feel free to complete these as you see fit.
* '''Active''': This checkbox can be used to toggle availability of the API key, which is generated and presented to you when the application is saved.
* '''App Location''': This field presents four options for specifying the application's location. The majority of users choose <code>No Storage Required</code> because the API key will be used in conjunction with a mobile or web application, or via a server-side script.
* '''Assign a Default Role''': Use this field to assign the newly created role to your application. Click on the select box and choose the role.

Click '''Save''' button and the new API key is generated.
